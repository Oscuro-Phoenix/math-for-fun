Hi, I'm Shakul. I'm a Pre-Final Year Chemical Engineering undergrad at IIT Kharagpur. 

As a Person, I’m really friendly and you can ping me for genuine problems or a friendly chat.

I love Problem Solving as a whole and don’t seem to have a knack for solving specific types of problems. It’s definitely a weakness as well as a strength!

I'm currently exploring  Microfluidics, Fluid Flow Simulation as well as Statistical Mechanics. Most of my interests lie in modeling and simulation of dynamic systems.
