Hi, I'm Shakul. I'm a Final Year Chemical Engineering undergrad at IIT Kharagpur.

As a Person, I’m really friendly and you can ping me for genuine problems or a friendly chat.

I love Problem Solving as a whole and don’t seem to have a knack for solving specific types of problems. It’s definitely a weakness as well as a strength!

I have previously worked on project that have involved Microfluidics, Fluid Flow Simulation as well as Statistical Mechanics. Most of my interests lie in modeling and simulation of dynamic systems. I am excited to explore my research interests as a Ph.D. student in the Department of Chemical Engineering at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology (MIT).

Hello, I am Sourim, currently a final year Chemical Engineering undergraduate student at IIT Kharagpur.

I am interested in solving mathematical problems of all domains and understanding them from a not so conventional perspective. I love to explore geometry, calculus, number theory, statistics and sometimes their applications to the physical world.

Apart from the usual academic chores, I spend time learning the harmonica, solving Rubik's cube or playing chess. In my leisure time, I like to read a book or watch a movie.

I am an incoming Graduate student at Purdue University and I'm looking forward to work on the dynamics of electrochemical systems and battery. I am always eager to have a friendly discussion about any genuine problem. Please feel free to contact me anytime
