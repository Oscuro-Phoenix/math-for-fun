Hi, I'm Shakul.

As a Person, I’m really friendly and you can ping me for genuine problems or a friendly chat.

I love Problem Solving as a whole and don’t seem to have a knack for solving specific types of problems. It’s definitely a weakness as well as a strength!

I'm currently exploring  Microfluidics, Fluid Flow Simulation as well as Statistical Mechanics.
