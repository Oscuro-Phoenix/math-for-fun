Hi, I'm Shakul! I'm a ChemE PhD student at MIT.

As a Person, I’m really friendly and feel free to connect on LinkedIn for anything between a friendly chat and work.

I love Problem Solving as a whole and don’t seem to have a knack for solving specific types of problems. I am fascinated by how fundamental mathematics binds itself into
some of the most puzzling problems in engineering, physics and computer science. This blog is a part of my attempt at sharing this fascination with the world.

Hello, I am Sourim, currently a ME PhD student at Purdue University.

I am interested in solving mathematical problems from all domains and try to explain them from different perspectives. I see this blog as a platform to reach out a broader audience interested in basic mathematics and engineering puzzle problems.

Apart from the usual academic chores and research, I spend time learning the harmonica, reading a book or watching a movie.

Please feel free to contact me via email or linkedIn for a friendly discussion on a problem or in general.
