Hi, I'm Shakul! I'm a ChemE PhD student at MIT.

As a Person, I’m really friendly and feel free to connect on LinkedIn for anything between a friendly chat and work.

I love Problem Solving as a whole and don’t seem to have a knack for solving specific types of problems. I am fascinated by how fundamental mathematics binds itself into
some of the most puzzling problems in engineering, physics and computer science. Through this blog, I try to share this fascination with the world.

Hello, I am Sourim, currently a final year Chemical Engineering undergraduate student at IIT Kharagpur.

I am interested in solving mathematical problems of all domains and understanding them from a not so conventional perspective. I love to explore geometry, calculus, number theory, statistics and sometimes their applications to the physical world.

Apart from the usual academic chores, I spend time learning the harmonica, solving Rubik's cube or playing chess. In my leisure time, I like to read a book or watch a movie.

I am an incoming Graduate student at Purdue University and I'm looking forward to work on the dynamics of electrochemical systems and battery. I am always eager to have a friendly discussion about any genuine problem. Please feel free to contact me anytime
