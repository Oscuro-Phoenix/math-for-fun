# Problem 7 : A different proof of Pizza Theorem

To all the pizza lovers, this theorem may give you relief that there can't be any unequal divison between you and your friend if you slice a pizza in a certain way. 
Let's say you choose a point other than the center of the pizza(assuming it as a circle) then cut it in n slices where n is a multiple of 4. The second condition is that all the slices should produce $2\pi/n$ radian at your point. Now if you choose alternate pieces the theorem tells that both of you got the same amount of pizza and that is equal to half of the are of the circle.
