# Problem 30 : A Formula for the nth prime

We will build the formula bottom up. So, let us begin!

# Wilson's Theorem

If $$p$$ is a prime number then we must have $$ (p-1)! \equiv -1 (mod p) $$.

 ## Quick proof

 It is easy to see that by the definition of a prime number if $$p$$ is not prime, it will be divisible by some number in between $$ 1 $$ and $$ p-1 $$. This implies that for any non-prime number $$p$$ we have, $$ (p-1)! \equiv 0 (mod p)$$.

 Now, if $$p$$ is prime, we are sure to have a non-zero remainder in the congruence relation. Furthermore, note that for any number $$x$$ in the range from $$2$$ to $$p-2$$ we must have another number $$y$$ within the same range such that $$xy \equiv 1 (mod p)$$. This can be understood by first noting that all numbers less than $$p$$ are relatively prime to $$p$$ i.e. $$gcd(q,p) = 1$$ $$\forall q < p$$. Furthermore, this fact combined with the Bezout's Lemma (See Proof) which guarantees the existence of $$s,t$$ such that $$qs + pt = 1$$ gives us the result that $$ qs \equiv 1 (mod p)$$ with $$s$$ being the modulo inverse of $$q$$.


# Using Wilson's Theorem to count primes

Now, we are in a position to use Wilson's Theorem to count primes! All we need to do is plug it into a function that would gives us zeros/ones depending on the primality. To this end, we can utilize a the cosine function as follows,

$$
\# of primes \leq i = \sum_{j=1}^i\left[\left(\cos \frac{(j-1) !+1}{j} \pi\right)^2\right]
$$

where the argument of the cosine is going to be a multiple of $$\pi$$ if and only if $$j$$ is a prime.
