# Problem 10 : Ceva's Theorem

I got reminded of Barycentric coordinates after reminiscing one of my courses in Mass Transfer (in fact, the most memorable one). We had to make extensive use of the ternary phase diagram given that 3 species (the solvent, the solute, and the carrier) are involved in a typical extractor (a separation process).

Given a triangle ABC, let the lines AO, BO and CO be drawn from the vertices to a common point O (not on one of the sides of ABC), to meet opposite sides at D, E and F respectively.

$$
\frac{A F}{F B} \cdot \frac{B D}{D C} \cdot \frac{C E}{E A}=1
$$


# Barycentric Coordinates


# Proof
