# Problem 1 : An Interesting Problem on Probability

Well, I have a nice picture which states the statement of the problem.

## Solution :

The very first thing that should strike one's mind is that the value of this probability does not depend on the number of the horizontal lines. Or in other words, the problem configuration can be though of as being infinite in the vertical direction.

Considering this we can wrap these inifinite vertical strips by realizing the periodicity and just consider one set of two parallel horizontal lines $$w$$ with 2 needles of length $$l$$ effectively giving us a rectange with dimensions $$l$$ x $$w$$ 

A wrapping of a rectangle about an axis parallel to its width ($$w$$) would be a cylinder with radius $$ l/\pi $$. (Basically, rolling a $$l$$ x $$w$$ rectange to form a cylinder with circumference $$l$$ and height $$w$$)
