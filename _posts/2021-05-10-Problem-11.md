# Problem 11 : Lorentz Equation : Laser problem

Chaos, a weird still fascinating branch of mathematics that deals with nonlinear real systems and gives a non-reapeating finite values as solution for a certain range of parameter values. To start the disucssion we have to introduce the famous Lorentz equation for atmospheric covection modelling. The most simplified version is 

$$
\.{x}=\sigma(y-x)
\.{y}=rx-y-xz
\.{z}=xy-bz
$$

Where x, y, z are the dynamical variables and $$\sigma$$, r, b are the physical parameters. Based on certain values of the variables the systems shows chaoctic behavior. In this post we are going to describe a similar system on the laser physics domain. The problem is taken from the book "Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos" by Steven Strogatz. So, let's get started.

We are going to consider a solid state laser source that started to emit laser light upon excited by a external energy source. The energy will excite the atoms inside the active material and they emit photons of different energies. There exists a threshold limit for the number of excited atoms generated which decide the emitting light will be laser light or not.

This phenomena is governed by the Maxwell-Bloch nonlinear equation and the simplified version is given below,

$$
\.{E}=\kappa(P-E)
\.{P}=\gamma_1(ED-P)
\.{D}=\gamma_2(\lambda+1-D-\lambda EP)
$$

Where E,P,D are the dynamical variables and $$\kappa$$, $$\gamma_1$$, $$\gamma_2$$ and $$\lambda$$ are the system parameters.
The questions are,
(a)Find a change of variables that transforms the system into the Lorenz system.
(b)Show that the non-lasing state (the fixed point with E* = 0) loses stability
above a threshold value of $$\lambda$$, to be determined. Classify the bifurcation at this laser threshold.
