# Problem 4 : A Problem in Triangle Goemetry

This is one of those problem's that's close to my heart. I had encountered a similar problem during my High School days. This problem involving a triangle seemed simple at first (very similar to an old sibling-problem) and that's just what caught me in a loop of attempts. Finally, I was able to come up with a very different approach.
