# Problem 27 : The Chinese Remainder Theorem

I have been meaning to write this out for a long time now. This is a powerful theorem that to me allows one to effectively deduce the subspace of solutions to a series of congruence relations. As far as history goes, the earliest known statement of the theorem is present in the 3rd-century book Sun-tzu Suan-ching by Sun-tzu.  

# Theorem Statement

Suppose that we have a sequence of $$ k $$ natural numbers $$ n_1, n_2, \ldots n_k $$ that are relatively prime i.e. their greatest common divisor, gcd $$ (n_i,n_j) = 1 \forall i \neq j $$.

Then the following system of equations,

$$
\begin{gathered}
x \equiv a_1 \quad\left(\bmod n_1\right) \\
\vdots \\
x \equiv a_k \quad\left(\bmod n_k\right)
\end{gathered}
$$

has a unique solution modulo $$ n_1.n_2.n_3 \ldot n_k$$.


# The Modulo Inverse


# Proof


### This completes the proof.
