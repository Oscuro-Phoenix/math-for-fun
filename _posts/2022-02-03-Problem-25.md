# Problem 25 : Möbius  Transformations and Symmetry

On first glance, Möbius Transformation appears to be a simple ratio of two functions that are linear in the complex variable $$z$$.

$$
\zeta = f(z) = \frac{az+b}{cz+d}
$$

where points in the $$z$$ plane are mapped to points in the $$\zeta$$ plate.

But the transformation has several interesting properties. One of these properties involves preservation of a certain symmetry that will be discussed in this post. For all the Electrical Engineering folks reading this, it is safe to assume that you may have used something similar unknowingly (Smith Chart?).

## Mobius Transformation as a combination of simple transformations

Some algebra will reveal that the expression for $$f(z)$$ can be written as 

$$
f(z) = \frac{a}{c} + \frac{bc-ad}{c^2(z+\frac{d}{c})}
$$
