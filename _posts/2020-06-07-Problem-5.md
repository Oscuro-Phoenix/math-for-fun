# Problem 5 : A Problem in Number Theory

I attended a coaching center that tutored me for sitting for competitive examinations. So, it wasn't unexpected that I'd come across students who were extremely brilliant. Back then, I met an interesting guy who'd give up all other problems and sit with interesting mathematical theorems. This just was one of the few theorems that have become etched in my mind.

# Problem Statement

The Chicken McNugget Theorem (or Postage Stamp Problem or Frobenius Coin Problem) states that for any two relatively prime positive integers $$m,n$$, the greatest integer that cannot be written in the form $$am + bn$$ for nonnegative integers $$a, b$$ is $$mn-m-n$$.

# The Solution

It is easy to see that $$mn - m - n$$ cannot be written in the form $$ am + bn$$. We need to show that for any whole number $$k$$, $$ mn - m - n + k $$
can be written in the form $$ am + bn $$. WLOG consider $$ n > m$$, we can formalize the equation we need to prove as -

$$ \exists \alpha >=1 , \beta >= 1 $$ $$ \alpha.m + \beta.n = mn + k $$ for all $$ k >= 0 $$

We can simplify this by
