# Problem 32 : Proving a circuit impedance formula

It was the roughly the start of 2015 with about a year left for JEE (Entrance Exams for IITs). Calculus and Analysis formed a big part of the syllabus. We were often asked to remember some strange infinite series that were, at times, quite useful for limits or approximating integral but never made complete sense to me. In my attempts to better understand this, I joined a couple forums such as Mathematics Stack Exchange and Brilliant.org. I had even subscribed to weekly reccurence and series newsletter from the Mathematics Stack Exchange and I often saw a lot of series and continued fractions. There was a lot of reference to complex analysis (something we eventually covered at IIT in our first year). Now that I look back, things are starting to make sense specially now that my work at MIT has led me to stumble upon similar things again in a different light. More specifically, this post is relies on Gauss's formula of continued fractions. 

This problem involves derivation of a generalized impedance formula (see below for explanation) $$ A (j\omega)^{-n} $$ where $$ j = \sqrt{-1}$$ and $$\omega$$ represents angular frequency of the response. The derivation is detailed in [this paper](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1149/1.2100789/pdf). As always, I will focus on delivering a "feel" of the method rather than going through all the steps. Let's jump right in... 

## A Game of Sticks

Let's say we have a stick of length $$x$$ and another stick of length $$y$$ where $$x > y$$. If I were to ask you to measure the longer stick $$x$$ using the shorter one $$y$$ there is one specific mathematical operation that immediately comes to mind i.e. division. Specifically, I would measure roughly $$x/y$$ times to see how many $$y$$ sticks is the $$x$$ stick. 

Now let us say we can remove the measured portion from $$x$$ stick which leads to a reduced stick $$z = x - y\left \lfloor {x/y} \right \rfloor$$ which would necessarily have it's length lower than $$y$$. This makes $$y$$ the longer stick now! This puts us at a recursive spot where can mesure $$y$$ using $$z$$ stick. In fact, we could keep going like this until we are done "measuring" $$x$$, the stick we started with. 

Wait, but how does all of this relate to continued fractions? Well, it'll be clear in a moment. Let's write our the math for what we just did. 

$$
\begin{equation}
x/y = \left \lfloor {x/y} \right \rfloor + z/y
\end{equation}
$$
$$
\begin{equation}
y/z = \left \lfloor {y/z} \right \rfloor + w/z
\end{equation}
$$
and so on... eventually leading to the following result that $$y/x$$ can be expressed as...

$$
\begin{equation}
y/x = \frac{1}{\left \lfloor {x/y} \right \rfloor + z/y} = \frac{1}{\left \lfloor {x/y} \right \rfloor + \frac{1}{\left \lfloor {y/z} \right \rfloor +  \dots }}
\end{equation}
$$
where $$ z = x -y\left \lfloor {x/y} \right \rfloor$$, $$ w = y -z\left \lfloor {y/z} \right \rfloor$$ and so on... 
In fact, letting $$\left \lfloor {x/y} \right \rfloor = a_1$$, $$\left \lfloor {y/z} \right \rfloor = a_2 \dots$$, we can write this more compactly as, 
$$ 
\begin{equation}
y/x = \frac{1}{a_1 + z/y} = \frac{1}{a_1 + \frac{1}{a_2 +  \dots }}
\end{equation}
$$
which is nothing but the continued fraction representation of $$y/x$$ and is bound to end at some point as the smaller stick lengths approach 0 given $$ y > z > w > \dots \geq 0$$ and $$y/x$$ is (hopefully) rational.

## The Problem 

The mathematical statement of the problem is as follows, we want to show that the following continued fraction,

$$
\begin{equation}
Z(\omega) = r_0 + \frac{1}{c_0 z + \frac{1}{r_1 + \frac{1}{c_1 z + \dots}}}
\end{equation}
$$

converges to $$ Z(\omega) = (j\omega)^{-n}$$ for $$z = j\omega$$ and certain values of the $$r_k$$ and $$c_k$$ values given by,

$$ r_k = 2h^n \frac{\Gamma(1-n)}{\Gamma(n)}\frac{\Gamma(k+n)}{\Gamma(k+1-n)} - h^n \delta_{k0}$$ 
and
$$c_k = (2k+1)h^{1-n}\frac{\Gamma(n)}{\Gamma(1-n)}\frac{\Gamma(k+1-n)}{\Gamma(k+1+n)}$$

## Wait, what is impedance and why do we care?

Simply put, impedance may be seen as a way to characterize electrical (and other coupled) properties of a system by applying a sinusoidal perturbations in a specific input variable (such as voltage) to record the response in an output variable (such as current). This perturbation can be applied for a range of frequencies to then calculate the ratio of the output to input variable. This ratio is analogous to resistance in the *linear* Ohm's Law and when applied to the frequency domain is called impedance. Such an impedance (typically denotes as Z) which may be represented as a complex number (recall the Euler formula) is often represented by the locus of points i.e. a parameteric curve in the Re(Z) vs -Im(Z) [Why is this negative?] plane where the parameter is frequency ($$\omega$$).
