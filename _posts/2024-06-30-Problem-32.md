# Problem 32 : Proving a circuit impedance formula

It was the roughly the start of 2015 with about a year left for JEE (Entrance Exams for IITs). Calculus and Analysis formed a big part of the syllabus. We were often asked to remember some strange infinite series that were, at times, quite useful for limits or approximating integral but never made complete sense to me. In my attempts to better understand this, I joined a couple forums such as Mathematics Stack Exchange and Brilliant.org. I had even subscribed to weekly reccurence and series newsletter from the Mathematics Stack Exchange and I often saw a lot of series and continued fractions. There was a lot of reference to complex analysis (something we eventually covered at IIT in our first year). Now that I look back, things are starting to make sense specially now that my work at MIT has led me to stumble upon similar things again.

In this post I'll share derivation of a generalized impedance formula $$ A (j\omega)^{-n} $$ detailed in [this paper](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1149/1.2100789/pdf). As always, I will focus on getting a "feel" of the method rather than going through all the steps.


## Why Gauss's Formula is beautiful?

## Wait, what is impedance?

## Proof
