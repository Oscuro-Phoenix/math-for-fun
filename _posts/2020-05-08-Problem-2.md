# Problem 2 : A problem on Linear Classification

So, we come back to another interesting problem involving some interesting geometry and calculus. This is the famous Support Vector Machine Classifier. While there are many pretty explanations of the math behind the SVM I'd like to add my two cents. The problem in its simplest form is best defined as finding a "dividing line" between two kinds of points.
