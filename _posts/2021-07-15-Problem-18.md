# Problem 18: Mixture of Gaussians - A Soft Classification Approach (ft. Jensen's Inequality)

The Bayesian framework for solving problems has already turned into a phenomenon. A hard classification approach like the K-means algorithm does not let you discuss about uncertainty or certainty with which you can say that a data point belongs to a specific class/group. This calls for a probabilistic approach and the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) which has been around for more than three decades.
