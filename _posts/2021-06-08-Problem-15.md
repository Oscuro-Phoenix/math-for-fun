# Problem 15: DFT and multiplication of two polynomials of degree 'n'

The fourier transform is a well known mathematical transform that changes a given function from its space/time domain representation to a frequency ($$ \omega $$) domain representation. In the continuous case, the transformation is an integral of a function ($$ f(x) $$) times $$ exp(-i.\omega.x) $$ over the entire real axis. Therefore, the discrete counter part of the fourier transform naturally results in a summation. 

In this article, our objective is to draw a natural connection between the solution to the computational problem of multiplying two polynomials of degreen 'n' (say $$ A(x) $$ and $$ B(x) $$) in time complexity O(n.log(n)) and the discrete fourier transform. 

Consider a polynomial of degree 'n' given below:

$$
A(x)=a_{0} x^{0}+a_{1} x^{1}+\cdots+a_{n} x^{n}
$$

We need $$ n + 1 $$ points to determine all the $$ n + 1 $$ coefficients of a polynomial function that passess through the points. Therefore, we could find the product of the two polynomials by evaluating each of the polynomials at $$ 2n + 1 $$ points for obtaining the resultant polynomial of degree $$ 2n $$. It is easy to see that evaluation of the value of the resultant product of $$ A(x) $$ and $$ B(x) $$ at the $$ 2n + 1 $$ points would have a time complexity of O(n).

The computationally expensive part comes here - We need to calculate the $$ 2n + 1 $$ coefficients from the $$ 2n + 1$$ points such that the overall time complexity remains O(n.log(n)).
